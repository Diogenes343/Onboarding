# Live Orientation Display

## Background
- The relative orientation of an object, such as a CubeSat, can be computed through inertial vector measurements (magnetic field, acceleration, angular rate).
- Due to the noise, disturbances and drift of measurements, sensor data must be fused using filtering techniques (such as the complimentary filter or Kalman Filter).
- Filtering is critical to attitude determination algorithms of CubeSats, which enables accurate attitude control
- This project is a gateway to learn about ADCS algorithms while making something visually epic in the process!

## Project Objectives
- Learn how sensor filtering techniques work to provide more accurate estimations of a system's state
- Process real-time data by interfacing with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and microcontroller
- Program a Live Orientation Viewer
