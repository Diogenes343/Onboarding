# Intro to Electronic Design & Altium

## Background Info
- Electronic components refer to parts of a circuit. Things like resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors ICs, LEDs,
  when configured intentionally, manipulate electric currents and voltage signals to perform cool functions.
- Integrated Circuits (ICs) package a complex circuit into a small chip which performs specific functions, making it
  easier to achieve what you want without having to build the low level circuit.
- Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) house electronic components into small form factors, using embedded copper traces separated with
  dielectric substrate. This is more reliable and compact than connecting components with loose wires.

## Altium Designer
- Altium is a PCB design software.
- You will need to obtain a free student license and install Altium Designer on your device through here:
  https://www.altium.com/education/students
- PAST also has a computer with Altium installed if you need.

## Getting Started in Altium
There are so many online tutorials and resources to help you gain familiarity with the Altium IDE. Here are some to 
get you started:
- [Altium Designer Walkthrough](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/tutorial-complete-design-walkthrough?srsltid=AfmBOoqkGIepiJsCApQ-1vasckeoRjSUaeAYHLYKAWCuF9ruBfx9nrcR#the-design)
- [Altium Designer Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTGzncKU5RY)
- Spacecraft Videos

Don't hesitate to ask for help in the Recruits Discord Server as well.

## Important Notes
- When creating an Altium Project, you should import JLCPCB Design Rules. Find instructions in:
  [Avionics Schematic-PCB Instructions.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18704231/AVI-SPCB.Avionics.Schematic-PCB.Instructions.docx)
- Follow [Avionics Recommended Electronic Components.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18718183/Avionics.Recommended.Electronic.Components.docx). The standard component footprint for passives is 0603.
