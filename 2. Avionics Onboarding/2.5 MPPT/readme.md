#  **Maximum Power Point Tracking**
## **Introduction**
MPPT or Maximum Power Point Tracking is most often used in solar power modules in order to ensure that the most power is provided from the solar panels.
When high voltage draw, current lowers and vice versa, therfore to make max power you must balance voltage and current.

## **Task**
For this task, you are required to research MPPTs, and;
- Write in short, an overview of the inner workings of an MPPT, and;
- Design a basic MPPT circuit to charge a Battery using solar power.
